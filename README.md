# GIS_international_boundaries
# What is this project
This is my coursework code for understanding GIS. 
This project is aimed to find and calculate the shortest internationational boundary in the world as soon as possible.
International boundary means the boundary that a country shares with another.
# What data you need
You need a file that documented the boundaries of every country in the world.
# What method I used
Basically, loop each country in the world to find all international border and compared the length of the border. 
I used spatial index to speed up the loop.
# What is the output
You can get the location, shape, and the length of the shortest international boundaries in the world.
The answer, which can be easily found, is Italy and Vantican.
Time to run the code is also calculated.
If you have any idea how to speed up the code feel free to leave a comment or pull request.
# Other information
This is my master's coursework at the University of Manchester. 
If you are a student and your professor leave you with the same coursework, I'll advise you to figure out the code by yourself.
You can have a glance at my code and see the structure just for reference, that's totally fine.
